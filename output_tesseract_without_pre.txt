ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE a)

Corn is protected from injury by N,N-dialkylthiolcar-
bamate ester pre-emergent herbicides by coating the corn
seeds prior to planting with a non-phytotoxic quantity of
a bifunctional compound selected from the group consist-
ing of 1,8-naphthalic anhydride, lower alkyl 1,8-naph-
thalate esters, N,N-diallyl-1,8-naphthalamic acid, barium
and tin 1,8-naphthalates, 1,8-naphthalic acid, propynyl-
amine salts of strong inorganic acids, N,N’-diallylox-
amide, N,N’-dipropynyloxamide, N,N,N’,N’-tetrapropyn-
yloxamide and N,N’-dipropynylmalonamide.

of crop seeds with a non-phytotoxic quantity of an an-
tagonistic agent for a selective herbicide, thereby protect-
ing the crop from injury when the specific herbicide is
employed to control weeds. The aforementioned patent
specifically exemplifies the treatment of wheat seed with
compounds which are antagonists to barban and to cer-
tain thiolcarbamate herbicides.

In USS. Pat. 2,913,327 is disclosed a group of N,N-
dialkylthiolcarbamate herbicides. One of these, S-ethyl
N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) has proved to be
very effective and commercially attractive as a pre-emer-
gent herbicide. It would be desirable to use this herbicide
in corn fields but it has been found to cause abnormal
growth and stunting of corn plants, leading to Joss of
yield. The problem has been complicated by introduction
of new hybrid varieties of seed which are more susceptible
to injury by EPTC.

I have discovered that corn plants can be protected
against injury by the N,N-dialkylthiolcarbamates of U.S.
Pat. 2,913,327 by coating the seeds prior to planting with
an effective but substantially non-phytotoxic quantity of
a bifunctional compound selected from the group consist-
ing of 1,8-naphthalic acid, 1,8-naphthalic anhydride,
lower alkyl 1,8-naphthalate esters, N,N-diallyl-1,8-naph-
thalamic acid, barium and tin 1,8-naphthalates, propynyl-
amine salts of strong inorganic acids, N,N-dipropynylox-
amide, N,N,N’,N’-tetrapropynyloxamide, N,N’-diallylox-
amide and N,N’-dipropynylmalonamide. The invention is
described in detail and illustrated with specific examples
in the discussion which follows.

The antagonistic agents are applied to corn seeds and
their effectiveness is demonstrated in comparison with
both normally growing corn and unprotected, injured corn
by means of the following test procedure:

PROCEDURE FOR COMPARATIVE EVALUTION
OF ANTAGONISTS

To 5.0 grams of single cross corn seed in a 3 dram
vial is added 3% (150 mg.) of the test chemical and
0.1 ml. (2%) methanol. The vial is capped and shaken
for 20 seconds in a Spex mixer. Five seeds are planted
in a flat of greenhouse soil and lightly covered. EPTC
(ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate) is applied at a rate
of 8 Ibs./A. It is covered with soil and the fiat is watered.
In each fiat are two rows of untreated and four rows of
treated corn. When control corn (no herbicide) is 50 cm.
tall, the treatments are rated according to the following

system. Each treatment is rated according to the number
of plants emerged (0-5) the number distorted by EPTC
(0-5) and the height. Height is given the following nu-
merical value: 0=no plants, 1 is 5 cm. or less and is
equivalent to EPTC, 2 is 6 to 16 cm., 3 is 17 to 27 cm.,
4 is 28 to 38 cm., and 5 is 39 cm. or taller. These num-
bers are given in their respective order. A rating of 5-0-5
means that five plants emerged, none were distorted and
height was over 39 cm. The same procedure is repeated
in a few instances, using only 4% by weight of a few
specific compounds on the corn seeds.

Results obtained on a group of compounds are pre-
sented in the table below.

From the tabulated data it will be seen that some of the
herbicide antagonists give better results at lower applica-
tion rates, indicating that the effect is complicated by
phytotoxicity of the antagonist itself.

The preferred antagonists are 1,8-naphthalic anhydride
and N,N,N’-tetrapropynyloxamide. The seed-treating sub-
stances are readily available as articles of commerce or
may be manufactured by conventional methods from
available substances, the amides being prepared by reac-
tion of the acid chlorides with the corresponding amines.
Use of these antagonists to treat seed corn prior to plant-
ing makes possible the application of EPTC at a rate of at
least 10 1b. per acre, which in the past has been considered
beyond the range of feasibility. As a result of operation
of the method at such high rates of herbicide application,
complete control of all undesired plant growth is obtained,
in most instances. This type of result has been long de-
sired in the growing of hybrid seed corn, where the ap-
pearance of both weeds and volunteer corn plants in the
field is very detrimental. Operation of the preferred
method in the field is illustrated in the following exam-
ples.

——— EXAMPLE 1

A plot of ground was tilled and prepared for planting
corn, EPTC was then incorporated into the upper three
inches of soil by thorough mixing, at rates of 6 1b., 12 1b.
and 24 lb. per acre. Rows of Dekalb XL-45 and Pioneer
154fx025lf hybrid seed corn were planted two inches deep
in the soil, after treatment with varying amounts of 1,8-
naphthalic anhydride. The two varieties of seed corn were
selected because they differ greatly in their susceptibility to
injury by EPTC. Rows of untreated corn were planted in
treated soil and in nearby plots of untreated soil for pur-
poses of comparison.

About a week after planting, a rainy sason began, last-
ing about two weeks, during which time about eleven
inches of rain fell, This occurrence tended to increase
corn injury by EPTC.

The Pioneer variety of corn was given substantially
complete protection from EPTC at 24 Ib. per acre by %4
percent by weight of 1,8-naphthalic anhydride coated on
the seed prior to planting. Substantially complete protec-
tion of the Dekalb corn from EPTC at 6 1b. per acre
was also obtained with 14 percent 1,8-naphthalic anhy-
dride on the seed. At a seed treatment level of 1.0 percent

by weight the Dekalb corn was given substantially com-
plete protection from EPTC at both 6 Ib. and 12 Ib.
per acre.

In the areas treated with EPTC at rates of 12 1b. per
acre and 24 Ib. per acre there were no weeds during the
entire growing season up to and including harvest time.

Where substantially complete protection from EPTC
was obtained as disclosed above, there were no significant
toxic side effects and corn grew to generally normal height
by comparison to areas in which neither seeds nor soil was
treated and weeds were removed by hand.
